# microshell

## todo
- PATH dont change for everyone
- config file for PATH etc.
- ctrC line problem

### running (linux / mac)
u need `gcc`, `make` and `readline` library to C [(mac)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/readline#default)

while running the first time you probably should use commands below so config will generate correctly
```sh
cd /your/designated/location/for/microshell
git clone https://github.com/filipkojro/microshell.git
cd microshell
make
./microshell
```
